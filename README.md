# 🌐 Arone Fritz Lamanilao - 3D Developer Portfolio

### Built with React, GSAP, Three.js, TailwindCSS

Welcome to my fully animated, interactive, 3D developer portfolio designed to showcase my skills and **impress clients, recruiters, and hiring managers**. This is more than a portfolio—it's a web experience built with production-level code, scroll-based animations, and modern web technologies.

> ⚡ Inspired by Awwwards-level sites — built with React (Vite), TailwindCSS, GSAP, React Three Fiber, and Drei.
